### Political Sentiment Web App
(Kahlil Wehmeyer)

The purpose of this project will be to create a somewhat flexible web app the can gauge the sentiment
between to subjects based on tweets to determine which one has the better sentiment with Twitter users.
The main use of this web app would be to see how political candidates in the 2020 election are fairing
against one another. The web app will be able to go beyond political topics and determine which subject
has more favorable sentiment in cases that might be non political such as ‘Coca-Cola vs. Pepsi’ or ‘MacOS
vs. Windows’. The end result of the apps analysis will be to determine a winner which will be based on a
number of factors. Unlike a lot of Twitter based sentiment analysis projects we hope to add more weight to
our analysis by accounting for interactions with relevant Tweets, the corresponsing clout of the authors and
the overall impact it made.
